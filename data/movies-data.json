I do not always translate Vietnamese words in the piece to English because I hope to convey the moments of comprehension/miscomprehension between different languages and generational divides. We do not just translate words. We translate moments and grasp for meaning. We translate across time and glance backwards through the bittersweet filters of nostalgia and loss.\r\n\nI invite the viewer to experience the delicate moments of misreading and translation — imbue subtle gestures and tones with layers of interpretation. The symbolic actions and conversation between a mother and daughter reveal the secret language of refugee and immigrant survival: hy sinh (sacrifice), khó khăn (suffering), perseverance (chịu khó), and success (thành công). Wander between poetic voice, slip away into memory; pause and grasp for that undeniable force.\"",

Her work defies dominant narrative and meditates on the subtle textures of translation and memory. “The Undeniable Force of Khó Khăn” film is part of Mẹ, Translated,” a project on intergenerational language and love.\r\nNguyen’s other major project includes MISS/MIS, a feminist exploration of all things deemed ‘mis-’ –wrong, dirty, defiant, or ‘abnormal’. Her art experiments on translation, categorical impulses, and misreading emerged from her Ph.D. dissertation (UC Berkeley) on Vietnamese libraries, print culture, and reading. Her art has been published in transnational publications Diacritics, Ajar Press, and her scholarly projects have been funded by Fulbright and the National Academy of Education/Spencer.\r\nNguyen’s work bridges the diverse fields of history, technology, education, art, and language. As a refugee from the Vietnam War and English as a Second Language Learner, she is committed to advance the understanding of the complex history, culture, and language of Vietnam and its diaspora.",
        "director_statement": "I was raised by the moral compass of Confucian duty, Catholic guilt, and Vietnamese refugee fears of the unknown. As a child I held on to every story my mother shared about our family’s escape from war torn Vietnam and my miracle birth in a Malaysian refugee camp. Between Catholic prayer and helping out at our family restaurant, my mother bestowed upon me her secret language of refugee survival: hy sinh (sacrifice), khó khăn (suffering), and perseverance (chịu khó).\nGrowing up in America, my language of expression slowly transformed from Vietnamese to English, and my mother’s cultural vocabulary became increasingly foreign but powerfully totemic. I have studied Vietnamese language and history for over 8 years, and I am now a Ph.D candidate in Vietnamese history at UC Berkeley. I now re-examine those linguistic totems of my childhood with a scholarly intensity and compassionate vulnerability. I research, write, and make art about Vietnamese culture, history, memory, and language.",

However, it had gone through another war, desperately fighting to retain its independence. The life in Sài Gòn and its people, even during the war, stood their ground and retorted with resilience.\n\nUnfortunately and disappointingly, the Americans left South Vietnam to fend for itself. The struggle was not only apparent in South Vietnam, but also the aftermath of the Fall of Saigon in 1975. People who had fled–were now the Boat People. Risking their lives to escape a regime, they took to the open waters and took a leap of faith to find a better life. In a sense, the independence that South Vietnam rightfully earned had been short lived. The love that was once there is no longer alive. Ephemeral. That experience alone can sometimes be unheard because of the trauma it possesses, but subsequently, it is an experience that many refugees and undocumented immigrants go through because of war and bloodshed. In this case, if it was short lived... What was it like back then? What was going on during the fall? What happened when they were seeking refugee on these islands? How did they survive the difficult journey?\"",

I hope this piece serves as a reminder for the elder generation that their\nexperiences are very closely related and that our resilience to adapt to a new world can also be fully utilized by other ethnic groups facing similar traumatic experiences.",

Making \"an american family\" is both inevitable, and an immediate challenge. \"an american family\" continues my fascination in distilled moments of daily lives and complexity of different family dynamics. The kitchen, often a communal space, contains many private moments and buried feelings. Through various kitchen scenes, the film observes subtle gradation of cohabitation and human’s relationships. Though a very personal story, I hope this film will reach out to a big audience. As our lives and societies are in constant flux, how often do we share a kitchen with strangers?",
